# Overview:
In this project, I use the OSEMN process (Obtain, Scrub, Model, Explore, and Interpret) to understand and build a regression model for the King County Housing Dataset. My goal is to make insights for home owners in King County who want to maximize the selling value of their home. 

The questions I ask are centered around what the home owners can renovate in order to maximize their home value. Such questions involve the correlation of each independent variable with the dependent variable, price. 

After testing and tweaking the dataset using a variety of datascience tools, my model ultimately is able to predict home prices with a 77.2% certainty.
